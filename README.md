- 👋 Hi, I’m @trish-spaceexploreunit
- 👀 I’m interested in Game Dev. I want to expand my horizons into new and exciting options for making games. My biggest interest is games as a vehicle for non-traditional narrative. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about AI and experimenting with procedural generation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever game project you can throw my way! I'm eager to learn
